## Reflection

### Learning Outcomes
1. Learned Flutter
2. Learned how to use api to fetch data on stocks
3. State management (passing data to new pages)
4. UI design
5. Use firebase for authentication and database

### Unexpected Obstacles
* Fetching data from API can lead to problems because of asynchronous nature. 
* State management is difficult if not using a framework such as provider
